We provide bioinformatics training through both **shorter workshops** and **in-depth courses**. Upcoming workshops are listed above. 

#### 1. Workshops 

* **Next-Generation Sequencing**

    Short workshops on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. The goal of these workshops are to enable researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses using best practices.

* **Basic Skills for Data Analysis**

    Topics include R, data visualization using R, Linux shell, High-Performance Computing (HPC), version control, Research Data Management, etc.

#### 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses

These intensive courses run for 8-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning **how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses**. Topics include:

- Unix & High-Performance Computing ([O2](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/))
- NGS data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Variant calling)
- Statistical analysis using R
- Functional analysis

*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*
