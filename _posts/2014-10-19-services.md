While we can offer support in most areas of computational biology, HBC’s expertise are **focused on four key domains**:
 
### 1. Next generation sequencing analysis: 

Core analysts have extensive experience in [managing and analyzing sequencing data](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.org/), including whole genome and exome sequencing (quality control, mapping, re-alignment, variant calls, prioritization), RNA-seq (quantification and _de novo_ transcriptome analysis), genome assembly (reference guided and _de novo_) and epigenomics. We can also provide support in the design and and analysis of your customized NGS experiment. We follow **best practices** and re-use public workflows and tools wherever possible, but are happy to adapt existing methods and develop new solutions where required.

### 2. Functional analysis:

We can provide a path from genes to function by delivering extensive functional annotation, prioritizing new markers, and developing testable hypotheses for future experiments. We test for functional information using different gene set enrichment approaches (using Gene Ontology, pathway databases, and curated and generic gene sets), provide context by integrating your data with public resources such as [GEO](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and [ArrayExpress](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/), and explore the biological interaction space in co-expression and high-throughput interaction data sets using network analysis techniques.

### 3. Research computing support:

Our collaboration with the [HMS Research Computing](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/) team means that we can also help with more general problems of computational infrastructure to optimally support your project, including data storage, backup, server setup, and access to [Orchestra](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/#orchestra), a high performance cluster. Where needed we can also work with you to run large scale analysis on [Amazon’s AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) (Cloud) environment.

### 4. Grant support: 

We can **support grant proposals on short notice**. The Core’s team has extensive experience in providing standard descriptions for data management, user and security handling, quality controls, and data dissemination that fulfill NIH and NSF requirements and simplify the process of finishing your grant or manuscript.
